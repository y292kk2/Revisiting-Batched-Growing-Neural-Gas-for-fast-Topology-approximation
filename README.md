# Revisiting-Batched-Growing-Neural-Gas-for-fast-Topology-approximation

Growing Neural Gas (GNG) is an unsupervised learning approach for modelling topologies by interconnected units, so-called neurons. 
These neurons form a graph which can be visualized in two dimensions to highlight patterns and clusters in the data. 
In this article, we present a novel implementation of the GNG algorithm combining different improvements from other state-of-the-art approaches while utilizing PyTorch as a modern GPU computing framework.
This enables the utilization of GNG in other large-scale applications while maintaining a high degree of usability. 
Moreover, this open up ways to interconnect the GNG approach with other Deep Learning based approaches.
